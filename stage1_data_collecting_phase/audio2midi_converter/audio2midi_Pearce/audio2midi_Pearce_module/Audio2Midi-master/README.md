## Audio2Midi

MATLAB program to convert .wav files to .midi files.

Rough code.

Uses [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform), the program manually segments the audio file into timeframes. 

MATLAB now has the spectrogram function to perform STFFT automatically.

micropick.m is main file. 

I am no longer actively developing this.
